# Karachi-Transportation

Currently, the range of transportation facilities and methods in Karachi
is rather limited, and the methods that already exist are oftentimes less

with passengers, involve several interchanges and are confusing to
navigate. Ridesharing is also not commonplace and it’s difficult to make
it work out for a lot of people; this results in single-person journeys by

car which increases pollution and is inefficient. In short, lack of
transportation facilities in Karachi is a pretty big issue.
That’s where you come in. Your job is to create a solution to improve
Karachi's situation for public / private transportation by facilitating
ridesharing or showing opportunities to use public transportation. Feel
free to use open source information about Karachi's transportation system
and any live map APIs to help you. Your solution may be functional or
simply an interactive interface that serves as a proof of concept with
potential for true functionality. We would, of course, favour a solution
that has at least some functionality that can be proven in your
presentation.
